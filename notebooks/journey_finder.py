# Description of the journey finding algorithm            
# =========================================        
# The find function maintains one datastructure and a couple of constraints
# 
# Data Structure
# ==============
# The data structure is a dictionary with station_ids as keys and a tuple as values.
# The value tuple is structured as follows: 
#   (highest_probability, latest_departure_time, [connection tuples])
#   - highest_probability: 
#       The arrival probability of the best connection leaving from the station
#   - latest_departure_time: 
#       The departure time of the latest connection leaving the station that 
#       reaches the arrival station with very high probability (p >= max_probability)
#   - connection tuple: 
#       Holds information on a connection leaving the station. values: 
#           (index, arrival_probability, connection)
#           - index: 
#               Holds the index of the follow up connection in the 
#               connections list of the stop_station for the this connection
#           - arrival_probability: 
#               Probability to arrive on time at arrival station if this 
#               connection is taken
#           - connection: a connection object
#
# Constraints
# ===========
# min_probability: 
#   Minimum probability to arrive at arrival_station, 
#   journeys are discarded as soon as arrival probability drops below mini
# max_probability:
#   Journeys with probability >= max_probability are considered to always
#   arrive at arrival station on time. This value should be close to 1.0.
#   Once the algorithm finds a journey that leaves departure_station and
#   arrives with probability >= max_probability at arrival_station it 
#   will discard any connections that leave before the departure time
#   of that journey.
# departure_min_time:
#   Holds the departure time of the latest departing journey from 
#   departure_station that arrives at arrival_station with 
#   probability >= max_probability
#
# Algorithm
# =========
# The algorithm scans connections in decreasing arrival time.
# For each connection it checks whether the stop_station of the
# connection contains follow up connections that could be taken
# (note that the arrival_station contains a fake connection to
# mark the end of the journey).
# If there are connections in the stop station then the following happens:
#   For each connection leaving the stop_station the algorithm
#   calculates the probability of arriving on time if that connection
#   is taken after the current one.
#   The follow up connection yielding the highest arrival probability is 
#   selected as the optimal choice (this is provably the best choice
#   by the initial ordering of the connections).
#   Then the found arrival probability and the connections departure time 
#   are compared to the last entry in the start stations list of connection
#   tuples. If the new arrival probability and connections departure time
#   are not strictly worse than the last entries probability and departure
#   time the connection is added to the start stations list. Otherwise it
#   is discarded. The connection is also discarded if the constraints are
#   no longer satisfied.
#   
#   If the connection was added to the start station connections list, then
#   all incoming footpaths to the start station are explored. For each
#   footpath the algorithm checks if taking the footpath and subsequently
#   taking the connection gives a new potential departure connection for 
#   the footpaths start station. If this is the case then a new 
#   footpath connection is added to the footpaths start station.
#
# The algorithm terminates once it scanned through all connections or
# stops early if a journey is found with very high arrival probability
# and there are only connections left that arrive before the optimal
# journey departs.
